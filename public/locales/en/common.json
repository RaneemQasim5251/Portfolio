    "story1": "In a computer lab in Taif, she was no ordinary child. There, Raneem discovered a new language – writing her first lines of code in C at a young age, opening her eyes to a world of possibilities.",
    "story2": "The girl grew, carrying a metallic dream. With dedication, she built a robotic arm that mimicked human fingers, achieving second place in the global RoboFest championship. In every gear and wire, she saw creativity meet engineering.",
    "story3": "Raneem didn't only write poetry on paper; she wrote it in machine languages as well. An Arabic poem in her heart finds its way into an algorithm; every function and program she wrote carries a hidden rhythm from her poetry."
